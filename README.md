# Vengeful Scars

A community Site I started working on during the Autumn of 2020.
As a hobby I run a Roleplaying guild in the game Star Wars The Old Republic,
where we basically build and play our own Pirate themed game inside of the game.

This site is meant to do the following:

* Help with promoting the guild,
* Manage guild player assets (Character sheets, rules, etc),
* Provide tools for immersive playing (In character shop that updates your sheet),
* Provide tools for admins (Booty calculator (split the hull into shares), plan encounters, etc)
