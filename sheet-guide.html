        <h1>Sheet Guide</h1>
        <span style="font-size:2rem">A Guide to your own character sheet</span>
        <div id="intro">
          <p>
            <strong>Intro - What is a character sheet</strong><br/>
              If you are reading this, your probly thinking of making your own character
              sheet for one of your characters. That's great! But what is it good for,
              and why do you need one? Well, a character sheet contains all core abilities
              that make your character work and operate. It tells us GMs how good you
              are at taking a hit, dealing damage, avoid damage, and any other useful
              skill you might have in your arsenal. The sheet will help us determine
              how various actions affect your character, and help make out other useful
              things to be mind ful about your character. What is your characters
              current goal in life? Does it have any useful contacts? Does it have
              any distinctive personality trait that can give her an advantage/disadvantage
              in a social setting or combat? Be filling out these few sheets, you help
              us GMs saving ours of gussing how to best adjust a campagin to your
              prefered game style. If your character cant tell which way to point a
              blaster, or has deep fear of blood, maybe we won't have her going toe
              to toe with a rancor on her first day.
            </p>
              <strong>Getting started</strong><br/>
              At the moment we have all our structer placed in a Drive folder on google
              called <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zs9NnoEVng0Bn6pTR6jdIOtbJOD_q06P?usp=sharing" target="_blank"><em>D6 roll system</em></a>.
              This allow us to quickly find and see all players sheet and other useful stuff.
              The end goal however, is to eventually have all files and settings run from
              this site, but as many features are still under construction, we keep Drive running.
              This process will be slow and take time as it's done probono and done at the side
              of running the guild, events, and IRL life.
              If you have your own google account, we highly recomend right clicking the
              shared "D6 Roll System" folder and add it to your own Drive for easy access.
              You can also assign a special collor to it to really have it stick out.
            <p>
              Ones in the folder you'll be faced with a couple of files the most important
              ones here are <strong><em>The Star Wars Ropleplaying Game REUP.pdf</em></strong>
              and <strong><em>Sheets</em></strong> folder. The rest could be good
              for a more in depth experience about how SWTOR works compared to other game
              settings in the core book (The Star Wars Ropleplaying Game REUP.pdf), and a
              bigger outlet of weapons and equipments for your characters.<br />
              Inside of the Sheet folder, you'll find an excel sheet called <em>empty sheet</em>
              make a duplicate of this, as it's only a template file. Then you may be free
              to redesign and fill out the duplicate any way you want, as long as the same
              type and number of fields remains. Once that is done, you should download the
              REUP.pdf for quick jumping. you'll also find direct links to an online version
              in this guide as we refer to pages. These will open in a new tab or window
              (depending on browser settings) to make it easy to check it out without losing
              your progress in this guide. Let's get started!
           </p>
        </div>

        <div id="guide">
            <div id="race">
              <h2>Step 0 - Find your Race</h2>
              <p>
                Go to <a href="https://vengefulscarsonline.joeyjaydigital.com/assets/The-Star-Wars-Ropleplaying-Game-REUP.pdf#page=280" target="_blank"><strong>page 278</strong></a> in the REUP pdf Then look up the Race you are playing
                as since this will be deciding how many dice you can plays on attributes and Skills (Basically, your strengths and weaknesses).
                In the example below shows the data we're looking for.
                <p>
                  <strong>Languages:</strong> Add these langugages to the langugages section of your sheet.
                </p>
                <strong>Attribute Dice:</strong> This is the number of dice you can add to your Attributes (Dex, Str, Perc, etc.). All player character (none NPCs) gets <strong>+6</strong> additional dice.
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>DEXTERITY 2D/4D:</strong> This shows the races minimum and maxium allowed Dice to assign to an attribute. In this example, you may not have less than 2D Dexterity, and not more than 4D.
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Move:</strong> 10/12
                This shows the minimum and maximum of speed.  You always start at 10 unless otherwise instructed by DM.<br />
                <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/600034202846494735/600036621835829259/unknown.png" alt="Human Race example"/>
              </p>
            </div>

            <div id="attributes">
              <h2>Step 1 - Assign Attributes</h2>
              <p>
                Attributes are like an <strong>inborn instinct</strong> that doesn't require any learning, in the words of the amazing Tod Howard <em>"It just works!"</em>. E.g Perception, some people have the habillity to <strong>"just spot things"</strong> very well and be very good at spotting or notice small things or actions. This will be translated into a <strong>greater Perception attribute (4D6).</strong> Compared to a<strong> less perceptive / normal person (2d6)</strong>.
              </p>
              In accordance with your race data from <a href="https://vengefulscarsonline.joeyjaydigital.com/assets/The-Star-Wars-Ropleplaying-Game-REUP.pdf#page=280" target="_blank"><strong>page 278</strong></a>, start spending Attribute dice on points in <strong>Dexterity, Knowledge, Mechanical, Perception, Strength, Technical.</strong>
              Remember that you need to asign the minimum amount of dice to each Atrribute, to not exceede the maximum amount to each attribute, and that your total dice doesn't <em>exceeded</em> your races <strong>Attribute Dice +6</strong>.
              <br />
              <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/600034202846494735/613642911367561217/unknown.png" alt="Field indicators"/>
            </div>

            <div id="skills">
                <h2>Step 2 - Assign Skill Points</h2>
                A skill point reflects a character expertice in a specific field of learning after a vast amount of time. You could compare this with taking a major at a University.<br /><br />

                Once you've spend all your <strong>Attribute dice</strong> it's time to add skills to your character. A list of skills you can pick you'll find at <a href="https://vengefulscarsonline.joeyjaydigital.com/assets/The-Star-Wars-Ropleplaying-Game-REUP.pdf#page=36" target="_blank"><strong>page 34</strong></a> then you can find more detailed info of the skills on the following pages<br/>
                <strong>Note:</strong> Just because your character doesn't have any die assigned to said skill, it doesn't mean she can't use it. Only some skills in some situations requires training to use, that said, it's always good to keep your skills high. In case your lacking said skill, you're attribute dice will have to suffice.
                <br />
                <br />
                You get a total of <strong>7 Skill dice</strong> to spend on skills.
                There are a couple of way to "cheat" the system to make it seem you have more skills.
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong id="skill-pips">Transform 1 Skill Die to 3 Pips</strong><br />
                You can take one of your <strong>Skill Dice</strong> and transform it into <strong> 3 pips</strong>. Pips means that instead of getting an extra Die to roll, you only get a fixed number extra to your result. You can assign <strong>+1, +2</strong> which are pips. This way you can have a skill Die in Brawling looking like <strong>"2D+1"</strong> meaning when you roll brawling you roll <strong>2D6</strong> and then add a <strong>+1</strong> to the end result.
                <p>
                  <strong id="skill-specialised">Transform 1 Skill Die into 3 Specialized Dice</strong><br />
                  You have a scoundrel that is an ace with a blaster, and such, you wanna add a skill Die to <strong>Dexterity -&gt; Blasters</strong>.
                  This is a good move as it helps your aim with blaster weapons, however, maybe your character only uses a specific type of weapons, like a <em>Blaster Pistol</em> ? Then he wouldn't need to have the same aim on a <em>Blaster Rifle </em> if he never uses them. Instead you can transform <strong>1 Skill Die</strong> and say that instead of being good at all <em>Blaster Weapons,</em> you're specially good at <strong>"Blaster-Pistols"</strong>. Meaning you get your bonus when firing your blaster pistols, but not if you use a blaster rifle. Then you have <strong>2 more Specialized Dice</strong> you can spend before your <strong>Skill Die</strong> would be depleted.
                  <p>
                    <strong>Note:</strong> You may not upgrade a specialized skill with the same skill Die. Meaning when you transform a <strong>Skill Die</strong> to a <strong>Specialized Die</strong>, you got <strong>3 Specialized Dice</strong>. These must be assigned to <strong>different specialized skills</strong>. If you want to upgrade a specialized skill, you need to transform another skill Die. Think of the process like 1 Skill Die covering a major at university. The Specialized Die is like a course within said major. At year 1, you may take the 101 classes, but need to wait for year two for the next level of said class.
                  </p>
                  <strong>Note:</strong> You can see what type of  specializations you can pick for a skill on <strong>the skills detailed descriptions page</strong>. You may make more specializations together with your GMs if you can't find what your looking for.
                  <br />
                  <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/600034202846494735/600048919338287154/unknown.png" alt="Specialized Skill listing" />

                </p>
                <strong id="advanced">Advanced skills (optional)</strong><br />
                An advanced skill is a more difficult skill that requires a specific amount of pre-knowledge. These skills works differently from normal skills as they do not gain the attribute bonus, but do give their die code as a bonus to the prerequisite skills.
                Unlike normal Skills, Advanced Skills are supposed to be acquired over a long period of hard work. As such, they all have pretty high requirements on skills and points needed to be owned to unlock them.
                E.g. <em>(A) Surgery</em> requires a die code of 5D in <em>First Aid</em> in order to be able to assign <strong>1D</strong> in <em>(A) Surgery.</em>
                <p>
                  <strong id="advantage">Advantage / Disadvantage (optional)</strong><br />
                  You may add a disadvantage to your character which will hamper your character somewhat when playing. Maybe you got a <strong>Drug Addiction</strong> for example, that would mean that you need to have your fix or suffer penalties to your stats. Doing this however, will give you a couple of bonus dice that you may add to your skills.
                  On the other hand you could have an <strong>Advantage</strong> like <em>Extraodinary Sight</em> whish enables you to <strong>see 3x as far</strong>, but in exchange you suffer a<strong> -2D penalty to Skill dice.</strong>
                  For a list of Advantages & Disadvantages see <a href="https://vengefulscarsonline.joeyjaydigital.com/assets/The-Star-Wars-Ropleplaying-Game-REUP.pdf#page=30" target="_blank"><strong>page 28</strong></a>.
                  <p>
                    <strong>Always alert the GMs of any advantages / disadvantages your character may have, as it may effect events and gameplay significantly.</strong>
                  </p>
                </p>
            </div>

            <div id="equipment">
                <h2>Step 3 - Equipment</h2>
                On Page 2 of your Characters Sheet, there are a section where you might add <strong>Armor</strong>, <strong>Weapons</strong> and <strong>Equipment</strong>. All new character starts with <strong>5,000 Credits</strong> to spend on those types of items. This section starts at <a href="https://vengefulscarsonline.joeyjaydigital.com/assets/The-Star-Wars-Ropleplaying-Game-REUP.pdf#page=357" target="_blank"><strong>page 355</strong></a>.<br />
                Each pice of <strong>equipment, weapons, amor</strong> comes with a <em>Item Availbality</em> and <em>Item Restrictions</em>.<br/><br>

                <em>Item Availbality</em> is the general indication of <strong>how easily the equipment can be found</strong>, ranging from <em>1 (Readily Available throughout the known galaxy)</em>, <em>to 4 (rare items to obtain anywhere)</em>.<br /><br />

                <em>Item Restriction</em> tells you whether the piece of equipment needs a license to own or operate, this is described with the letters <strong>F (fee), R (restricted) or X (illegal).</strong>
                <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/600034202846494735/600066366418059294/unknown.png"  />
                <p>
                  <strong>Equipment</strong><br />
                  May be tools or items you need in the field, like medpacks, progrmaming spikes, breath masks, ammo packs, etc. Many of these also <strong>requires some type of Skill</strong> to use (Like medpack requires <em>First Aid</em> ) If you don't have it, you would have a hard time figuring out how to use it properly. Make sure you meet the Skill Requirments and check if it's <strong>single use item</strong> or not.<br />
                  <strong>Note:</strong> Some of these may come in packs which can save you a great deal of money, make sure to check it out before buying.
                </p>
                <strong>Weapons</strong><br />
                Sooner or later, you'll be hard pressed into a fight (pirate life ain't no pleasure cruise matey) As such it could be good too familiarise yourself with the weapons in the game.<br />
                <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/600034202846494735/600068072497479683/unknown.png"  alt="meele example" id="melee" />
                <p>
                  <strong><em>Melee Weapons</em></strong><br />
                  Just like equipment, you need skills to utilize a weapon. Make sure to check the <strong>"Skill:"</strong> section of the weapons discription to see what skill they require.
                  On your sheet, you then need to add the <strong>Weapon Type, Weapon Difficulty</strong>, and <strong>Weapon Damage</strong>.
                  <br />
                  <strong>Weapon Difficulty</strong> shows how difficult it is for a player to use a weapon correctly and is rolled by your own character. If you succeed, you would hit the enemy, if you fail, you could hurt yourself.
                  The <strong>Weapon Damage</strong> will show how many dice to roll when attacking.<br />

                </p>
                <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/600034202846494735/600069482110517249/unknown.png" alt="Ranged Weapon example" id="ranged" />
                <strong><em>Ranged Weapons</em></strong><br />
                The range weapons type still has the <strong>Skill Requirement</strong> part, but they lack the difficulty from the melee weapons which is substituted for the <strong>Range</strong> you wanna fire from.<br />
                <strong>Fire rate:</strong> shows how many attacks you can make with the weapon per round (most commonly 1)<br />
                <strong>Range:</strong> the distances you may fire from (in meters). Short / Medium / Long range<br />
                <strong>Damage:</strong> The dice you roll to deal damage
                <p>
                  <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/600034202846494735/600071214882357278/unknown.png" alt="Armor example" id="armor" />
                  <strong>Armor</strong><br />
                  This is gonna hurt... or not, depending on your equipment and stats.
                  Normally when receiving damage, you get to roll your Strength to avoid damage.
                  <strong>Damage Dealt</strong> would then be reduced by the <strong>Damage Soaked</strong> from <strong>Strength</strong> + any bonuses applied by your armor. Be sure to note any possible penalities the armor may give you.
