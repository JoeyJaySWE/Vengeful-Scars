    <h1>A pirate pirte life for you!</h1>
    <p>
        You seem like a charp mate if you found your way over here, cause that means that you're
        probably at least considering cutting the ties to your former life and join the free
        in the open space lanes. Living a life of adventure and excitement. 
        During your time, the ship will be your home, and the crew will be your family.
        Now, the galatic republic and Empire may try to paint us as a bunch of svages,
        but they're just jealous that we don't have a lightsaber up our arses keeping us from acting.
        The pirate life is merry and exciting, but it's not without it's risks so in order to keep our
        ship and home a float. As such we do have our own Pirate Code that we follow. Before we begin,
        there are two terms that we use frequently and could be good thing to learn:
    </p>



    <h2 class="join">OOC</h2><div class="break"></div>
    <strong class="subtitle">(Out Of Character)</strong>
    <p>
        The complete oppsotie. This when we talk to you as a person.
        You may OOC be against Piracy, but IC you may be the captain of a Pirate fleet.                The important thing is to distinguish the two from eachother.

        <h3>Player Rules</h3>
        <span class="subtitle">(OOC Rules)</span>
        <ul>
            <li>All members need to have a <strong>Discord</strong> account and join the server. This is to keep information about upcoming events and other types of information easy to manage for our GMs. Important messages are allways pinged to our members, so if you don't want to remain active, no need.</li>
            <li>Members start with 1 IC character. After gaining Pirate rank a new character may be created, up to 3 IC different characters. Alts of the same IC character type are allowed. In consultation with a GM more IC characters can be allowed.</li>
            <li>Respect each other, this speaks for its own. Respect other people and their beliefs; players ICly during RP and give them a chance to respond to you; the DM during an Event, they spend a lot of time to create content for everybody.</li>
            <li>To participate in Events with a character, make sure it has a personal starship in the game so we can summon you. Only characters with character sheets are allowed on events, so make sure you have one! (If you need help, ask a GM).</li>
            <li>Respect other players RP. If you're OOC, make sure you're out of the RP areas (we have an OOC area) or make sure people know you are OOC. Private RP is always to be kept private.</li>
            <li>During Events give room for the GM to do their job and to other players to do their thing. Your turn will come, don't you worry.</li>
            <li>Due to some previous bad experiences, we have implmented an age limit of <strong>18+</strong> for our players, and hope you'll respect that.</li>
        </ul>
    </article>
    


    <h2 class="join">IC</h2><div clas="break"></div>
    <strong class="subtitle">(In-Character)</strong>
    <p>
        This term is used to help distinguish you as a player from you as a chracter.
        When we're talking IC we are talking imersively to youe character, not you as a person.
        For example, IC, your chracter may now how to speak Hutties, but you yourself doesn't.
